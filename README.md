# Tetris

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using Python and Pygame. The game features the standard mechanics of Tetris, including falling tetrominoes, line clearing, and score tracking.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abeehimr/TETRIS.git
```
2. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine. If not, you can install Pygame using pip:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
3. Run the game:
```bash
python main.py
```
or 
```bash
python3 main.py
```
4. Use the arrow keys to move the falling tetrominoes left, right, or down. Press the up arrow key to rotate the tetromino. The game will automatically speed up as you progress.

5. Try to clear lines by filling complete rows with tetrominoes. Each cleared line will earn you points.
